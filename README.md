# Lung Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview

This repository implements advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically detect the presence of lung cancer from medical images, such as X-rays or CT scans. Early identification of lung cancer significantly improves treatment success rates, and this project aims to assist medical professionals with rapid, reliable diagnostic support.

## Features

- **Data preprocessing**: Image enhancement and noise reduction methods are applied to improve medical image quality prior to modeling.
- **Segmentation**: Identification and extraction of regions of interest in the images using edge detection and watershed segmentation.
- **Feature extraction**: Both region-based (area, centroid, perimeter) and statistical (mean, standard deviation) features are derived for analysis.
- **Machine learning classification**: Multiple algorithms, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), logistic regression, and transfer learning, are explored to distinguish between benign and malignant cases.
- **Performance metrics**: Model predictions are evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Dataset

The models are trained and evaluated on annotated medical image datasets, with a focus on CT scan and X-ray images of the lung. Publicly available datasets (e.g., LC25000, LIDC-IDRI) can be used for training and validation.

## Methodology

1. Input medical image data and apply preprocessing to reduce noise and enhance quality.
2. Segment the enhanced images to isolate suspected regions using edge detection and watershed segmentation.
3. Extract geometric and statistical features from segmented regions.
4. Train machine learning classifiers with labeled data to differentiate between benign and malignant tumor cases.
5. Evaluate model performance and refine classifiers to maximize diagnostic accuracy.
